a next-level user experience.
The intended software system to be produced is an online E-commerce web application. The availability of the system is intended to cover all the interested online shoppers
in Egypt,as the system is a cross-platform. The system shall be fully-controlled by the Admins, allowing them to add, delete, and edit products according to their current
inventory. The customers shall browse the web-application, add their desired products in the shopping cart, check out and start checking the order status up till the delivery
time. The overall scope is implementing an accessible, convenient means of communication that will be able to fulfill Stars Accessories growing reach, as Instagram is the main
selling platform for the brand,  the communication between the client and the customers occur solely through direct messages, our goal is to elevate that level of service that
requests and purchases would be stored in the store’s own database.
SA System shall evolve around 3 parties: Customers, Admins, Shipping company, and a database interacting with the system to connect those 3 parties together
